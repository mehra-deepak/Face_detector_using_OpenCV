# Face_detector_using_OpenCV
The projects uses OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) an open source computer vision and machine learning software library,
in order to detect faces.
For feature extraction and determination Haar Cascade Classifiers are used.A Haar Cascade is basically a classifier which is used to 
detect particular objects from the source. For Instance The haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml is a haar cascade designed by OpenCV to detect the
frontal face.
The model has been fed up with a set of images of some of the Personalities including Alessia Cara, Pop Singer, Daniel Radacliffe Hollywood Celeb etc
according to which whenever the pictures of these celeb are popped in front of the camera ,it tries to determine their identity.
